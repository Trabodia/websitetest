Concerns were expressed by these individuals when the news broke in the nation, chief among them being the impact on livelihoods. For this reason, we urge a reconsideration of the current phase out plan.</p><p>The PUV modernization is believed to have a huge economic impact to jeepney drivers and operators with an immense financial burden and a potential loss of income. On January 16, 2024 Philippine jeepney drivers and operators pulled off an intense protest in the capital Manila over the government. Those opposed to the phase-out argue that incorporating a cooperative and choosing a new vehicle will put them in debt and prevent them from earning enough money to survive.</p><p>"We are not against modernisation, what we are against is the system. They made a programme without consulting us," this is a statement by Emilio Millares, 59, who has been driving a jeepney for four decades and took part in the protest. Possibilities of this project fueled resistance among those reliant on the operation of traditional jeepneys. </p><p>Many of the operators and drivers are doubting the enhancement plan's feasibility and practicality. To ensure the long-term viability of modernized transportation for the public, it is imperative to implement a comprehensive and sustainable system to manage the transition that takes consideration of practicality like infrastructure readiness, operational costs, and the ability of modernized jeepneys to adapt to existing routes and communities.</p><p>Moreover, commuters expressed concerns about the possible effects of the phase-out strategy. It will possibly limit accessibility to people because of the rise in fares with higher operating costs, which will resist commuters' convenience as they are used to depending on the traditional, affordable modes of transit to go about their daily lives.</p><p>The government must review the modernization plan and establish policies that take the operators' and drivers' concerns into account. By doing this, we can make a shift that is fair and progressive. It is imperative that the proposed phaseout be tackled with a commitment to ensuring that adequate support systems are in place and limiting the harmful impact on vulnerable stakeholders.</p><p>Nobody is an opponent of modernization; it’s the poverty that the government’s plan is carrying, which is why we oppose it. As we try to modernize for the sake of our country, we must also consider the sake of our people just like our jeepney drivers and operators who have been dependent on traditional jeepneys to survive and are not capable of the speed transition that the government is trying to implement without an assurance of support. Our people's welfare must come first. With that being said, we must say no to the jeepney phase out.</p></div>
